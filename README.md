# Introduction
In this project we have built a 2D multi robot simulator with C++ and ROS. The software can simulate multiple robots and give the user the ablity to control each of them one at the time. Each robot is equiped whit a lidar sensor whose base scan can be visualized in RViz as a point cloud.
